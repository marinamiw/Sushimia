        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
        <li> 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided    </li>
        <li>1 medium onion, thinly sliced     </li>
        <li> 3 cloves garlic, minced    </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger     </li>
        <li> ½ cup rice vinegar, or to taste    </li>
        <li>½ cup reduced-sodium soy sauce     </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons oyster sauce     </li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons mirin    </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fish sauce     </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Sriracha sauce     </li>
        <li>4 cups low-sodium chicken broth     </li>
        <li> 1 cup water    </li>
        <li> ¾ pound baby bok choy, quartered lengthwise    </li>
        <li> 1 cooked chicken breast, shredded    </li>
        <li> 3 (3 ounce) packages dried ramen noodles    </li>
        <li>4 eggs     </li>
        <li> 1 jalapeño pepper, sliced, or to taste    </li>
        <li>2 green onions, chopped, or to taste     </li>
        <li> ¼ cup chopped cilantro, or to taste    </li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add onion and sauté until starting to soften, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and ginger; cook about 30 seconds more. Add rice vinegar, soy sauce, oyster sauce, mirin, fish sauce, and Sriracha sauce; stir to combine. Add chicken broth and water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for about 5 minutes. Stir in bok choy and chicken; simmer gently until bok choy is just tender, about 2 minutes. Cover and keep warm.

            </li>
            <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Add ramen noodles and return to a boil. Cook, uncovered and stirring occasionally, until noodles are tender yet firm to the bite, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain noodles and drizzle with remaining 1 tablespoon oil to prevent sticking.    </li>
            <li>While the ramen is cooking, fill a pot with enough water to cover the eggs and bring to a boil. Gently lower eggs into the boiling water and cook until yolks are barely set, about 7 minutes.

            </li>
            <li>Fill a large bowl with ice water. Transfer eggs to the ice bath to stop the cooking process; let sit about 3 minutes. Drain eggs, carefully peel away the shells, and slice in half.    </li>
            <li>Divide ramen between four bowls. Add broth, then top with jalapeño, green onions, cilantro, and soft boiled egg halves. Serve immediately.    </li>
